diffrent types of executuors in shell script is #!/bin/   bash, ksh, sh , dash  widly use is bash
what is the diffrence b/w #!/bin/sh and #!/bin/bash
previously both of them are same because #!/bin/sh is redircting to #!/bin/bash using linking concept but now it is not the same bacause some the OS have decided to use dash as 
defult so your script mide not execute if you are writing in bash scripting on a machine where the dash is defult.

to print anything in shell scripting we use echo for example echo "my name is srinath"
to execute shell script use ./ or sh command to execute

alwaye write metadata in starting of your shell script
example authou name, date, version, metion it as in comment

to execute the script in debug mode use set -x or use echo statemnet before the command best use debug mode to understand
if u dont want to show the commands simply the comment that line example 
#!/bin/bash

set -x

df -h

free

nproc

pwd


To find the the all processers running use ps -ef
to see the specific procrssers ID use ps -ef | grep "amazon"
pipe command sent the output of first command to second second command | this is pipe command

diffrent VM channels are stdin stdout stderr
date is a system defult command and using this command it send the out to stdin
but pipe will not able to receive the information from stdin.
pipe can only recive the information if not sending the information to stdin and if command ready to pass the information to another command
awk command filter out the information from output
ps -ef | grep amazon | awk -F " " '{print $2}'

set -e it exist the script if there is an errors and it can not cautch pipe fails so also use set -o pipefail
ser -o pipefile it use to exit the script is there is an error we cantot use this one only use set -e
this will see only output of last command if last commnd execute the if there is an error also it not exit

#!/bin/bash

# divisible by 3 , divisible by 5 , not 3*5 = 15


for i in {1..100}; do
if ([ `expr $i % 3` == 0 ] || [ `expr $i % 5` == 0 ]) && [ `expr $i % 15` != 0 ];
then
        echo $i
fi;
done
