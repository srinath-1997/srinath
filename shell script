diffrent types of executuors in shell script is #!/bin/   bash, ksh, sh , dash  widly use is bash
what is the diffrence b/w #!/bin/sh and #!/bin/bash
previously both of them are same because #!/bin/sh is redircting to #!/bin/bash using linking concept but now it is not the same bacause some the OS have decided to use dash as 
defult so your script mide not execute if you are writing in bash scripting on a machine where the dash is defult.

to print anything in shell scripting we use echo for example echo "my name is srinath"
to execute shell script use ./ or sh command to execute

alwaye write metadata in starting of your shell script
example authou name, date, version, metion it as in comment

to execute the script in debug mode use set -x or use echo statemnet before the command best use debug mode to understand
if u dont want to show the commands simply the comment that line example 
#!/bin/bash

set -x

df -h

free

nproc

pwd


To find the the all processers running use ps -ef
to see the specific procrssers ID use ps -ef | grep "amazon"
pipe command sent the output of first command to second second command | this is pipe command

diffrent VM channels are stdin stdout stderr
date is a system defult command and using this command it send the out to stdin
but pipe will not able to receive the information from stdin.
pipe can only recive the information if not sending the information to stdin and if command ready to pass the information to another command
awk command filter out the information from output
ps -ef | grep amazon | awk -F " " '{print $2}'

set -e it exist the script if there is an errors and it can not cautch pipe fails so also use set -o pipefail
ser -o pipefile it use to exit the script is there is an error we cantot use this one only use set -e
this will see only output of last command if last commnd execute the if there is an error also it not exit

#!/bin/bash

using curl command you can retrive the data from internet
using wget command you can download
find ----> find the the specifed files in you given names
sudo find / -name ssh


Interview questions
1) list some of the commonly used shell commands
ls , cp , mv, mkdir, touch, vim, grep, find, top free, df -h, 

2) write a simple shell script to list all processes
ps -ef | grep amazon | awk -F " " '{print $2}'

3) write a script to print only errors from a remote log
curlcurl google.com |grep error   using curl pipe and grep commands

4) write a shell script to print numbers divided by 3 and 5 and not 15
#!/bin/bash

#####################
#Authour - srinath
#date - 21/12/2024

###################

# divisible by 3 , divisible by 5 , not 3*5 = 15


for i in {1..100}; do
if ([ `expr $i % 3` == 0 ] || [ `expr $i % 5` == 0 ]) && [ `expr $i % 15` != 0 ];
then
        echo $i
fi;
done


5) write a script to print of "S" in mississippi
#!/bin/bash

x=mississippi

grep -o "s"  <<<"$x" | wc -l

6) how will you debug the shell script
set -x  it will run debug mode

7) what is crontab in linux can you provide an example of usage
 corntab is nothing but 


8) how to open read onle file
vim -r test.txt

9) what is the diffrence between soft and hard link


10) what is the diffrence between break and continue statements
   break ---> breaking the execution
continue ---> continuing the execution (skip) --> skip this continue the next

11)  what are the disadvantegs of shell scripting
     errors are frequently and costly, and a sigle error can alter the command
     the execution speed is low
     Bugs or inadequqcies un the language`s syntax or implimentation
     Large, complex tasks aren't well suited to it
     Contray to other scripting languages etc, it provides a minimal data structure
     Every time a shell command is executed, a new process is launched.

12) what are the diffrent type of loops and when to use
for loop, while loop, 


16) Is bash dynamic or statically typed and why
   bash is dynamically typed --- 


17) Expalain about a network troubleshooting utiliy
traceroute
