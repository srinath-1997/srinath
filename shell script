#!/  ---> shebag

diffrent types of executuors in shell script is #!/bin/   bash, ksh, sh , dash  widly use is bash
what is the diffrence b/w #!/bin/sh and #!/bin/bash
previously both of them are same because #!/bin/sh is redircting to #!/bin/bash using linking concept but now it is not the same bacause some the OS have decided to use dash as 
defult so your script mide not execute if you are writing in bash scripting on a machine where the dash is defult.

to print anything in shell scripting we use echo for example echo "my name is srinath"
to execute shell script use ./ or sh command to execute
